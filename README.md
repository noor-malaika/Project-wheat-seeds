# Project-wheat-seeds
This is a data science project of the infamous wheat seeds dataset that contains observations of three different species(kama, rosa, canadian)

This project contains data visualisations and a machine learning model implementation to make predictions.
For this purpose, i have utilized k-nearest neighbors (the ubiquitous classification algorithm) and the error rate and evaluation matrix are also
included.

Suggest if u have any recommendations...
